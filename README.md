# ADS Assignment 4: Graph, BFS and DFS Algorithms

## Student: A. Nazerke
## Course: Algorithms and Data Structures

## Overview
This project implements a complete graph toolkit with BFS and DFS algorithms. It includes:
- Graph ADT with adjacency list representation
- BFS with shortest path finding
- DFS (recursive and iterative) with cycle detection
- Maze solver application using BFS
